# __d_e_t_o_u_r__

## _an in-memory frame sampler/processor for rpi_	

<vector image coming soon>
 
__d_e_t_o_u_r__ is  _raspberry pi_ video performance tool that samples `input` video frames ( from _piCaptureSd1_ ) into RAM and allows dynamic short-term access to them via _midi control_ 
<demo video coming sometime>
this is an open community project based on the [proof-of-concept] @[Autr] and i created and inspired by the [JonesFrameBuffer]
